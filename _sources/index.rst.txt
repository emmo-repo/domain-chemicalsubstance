Chemical Substance Domain Ontology
==================================

Overview
--------

The Chemical Substance Domain Ontology is a specialized ontology
designed to provide persistent machine-readable identifiers for chemical
substances within the broader context of the Elementary Multiperspective
Materials Ontology (EMMO). It plays a crucial role in enhancing the
semantic representation of chemical entities and their relationships
within materials science and related domains.

Integration with EMMO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary purpose of the Chemical Substance Domain Ontology is to
seamlessly integrate chemical substances into the EMMO ontology
ecosystem. EMMO serves as the top-level ontology for materials science
and modeling, providing a standardized framework for describing
materials, processes, and phenomena. By establishing a domain ontology
for chemical substances, we bridge the gap between materials modeling
and chemistry, ensuring consistent and interoperable knowledge
representation.

Persistent Identifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This ontology assigns persistent machine-readable identifiers to
chemical substances. These identifiers are essential for accurate
referencing and linking of chemical data, ensuring data consistency, and
facilitating data exchange and interoperability among various tools and
systems. It includes annotations to other sources of information
including `PubChem <https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`__ and
`Wikidata <https://www.wikidata.org/>`__.

Standardized Nomenclature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ontology includes standardized nomenclature for chemical substances,
relying on `IUPAC <https://iupac.org/what-we-do/nomenclature/>`__
recommendations for naming coneventions. IUPAC is the
universally-recognized authority on chemical nomenclature and
terminology. This consistency in naming conventions enhances
collaboration and data sharing.

Key Features
------------

-  Seamless integration with the EMMO ontology.
-  Provides persistent machine-readable identifiers for chemical
   substances.
-  Standardized nomenclature for chemical entities.
-  Facilitates data exchange and interoperability within the EMMO
   ecosystem.

Usage
-----

Researchers, domain experts, and developers within the materials science
and chemistry communities can utilize the Chemical Substance Domain
Ontology for various purposes, including:

-  Incorporating consistent and standardized chemical substance
   information into their modeling and simulation activities.
-  Enhancing data interoperability between materials modeling tools,
   databases, and platforms.
-  Supporting research projects that require precise and standardized
   chemical entity representation.
-  Building applications, databases, or knowledge graphs that leverage
   EMMO and require chemical substance information.

Contributing
------------

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and expand the
Chemical Substance Domain Ontology. If you have suggestions,
improvements, or additional chemical substance information to
